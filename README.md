 # What I Learned

Although I already had a basic grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allowed me to apply those skills in a real, full-stack context. Building the frontend was incredibly rewardingâ€”I enjoyed designing the interface and making it interactive, seeing my ideas come to life.  

On the backend side, I learned how Node.js and Express.js work, including handling API requests, managing data, and connecting the frontend to a database. Combining both frontend and backend gave me a clear understanding of how data flows in a web application and how the different layers communicate.  

This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also improved my problem-solving and project-structuring abilities. Overall, it was a highly rewarding experience that boosted my confidence in full-stack development and prepared me for building more complex applications in the future.
